‚ùóÔ∏è**Assuming that you already signed up with you email**‚ùóÔ∏è

Use you API token for authorization. 

Get it with ‚û°Ô∏è `POST /api/v1/authentications/token?email={your_email}&password:{your_passord}`

You can use test user to try!
```
email: test_user1@snapask.com
password: secretsecret
```

You need to add `{ api_token: your_api_token }` in params for other APIs to authenticate.
